# FrozenLake-Reinforcement-Learning
## Frozen Lake Reinforcement Learning
This repository contains an implementation of the Frozen Lake problem using reinforcement learning techniques. The Frozen Lake problem is a classic grid-world environment where an agent must navigate a frozen lake to reach a goal tile without falling into holes.

## Description
In this project, we explore and apply reinforcement learning algorithms to teach an agent how to successfully navigate the Frozen Lake environment. The agent learns through interaction with the environment, receiving rewards for reaching the goal tile and penalties for falling into holes. The goal is to train the agent to find an optimal policy that maximizes its chances of reaching the goal.

We provide several different reinforcement learning algorithms, including:

Q-Learning: A popular off-policy TD (temporal difference) algorithm that learns the optimal action-value function.
SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action): An on-policy TD algorithm that updates the action-value function based on the next action taken by the agent.
Deep Q-Network (DQN): A deep reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a neural network as a function approximator to estimate the action-value function.
REINFORCE: A policy gradient algorithm that directly optimizes the policy by estimating the gradient of expected returns.
